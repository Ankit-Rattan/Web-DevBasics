    CSS: Cascading Style Sheet
    Syntax: 
        p( color: blue;)
        -> p : selector 
        -> color: property
        -> blue: value
    e.g: 
        header, p.intro{
                background-color : red;
                border-radius : 3px;
        }    
    
    Three ways to add css to the markup(HTML):
        1. Inline CSS: CSS is added to the element directly using style attribute.
        2. Internal CSS: CSS is kept inside the head tags in <style> tags.
        3. External CSS: CSS is kept separately inside a.css style sheet.    
    
    NOTE : Inline CSS have more priority than internal CSS.
         : Among Internal and external, jo baad me likhi hoti hain vo jyada precidence milti hain. 
         But if you want to give the first one more precedence then use "! important" in that style format.
    
    CSS Selector:
            -> is used to find the element whose property is to be set.
            -> You may select single or multiple elements.
            -> Four types of CSS Selector:
                -CSS element selector.
                -CSS id selector ->"#" is for id. 
                -CSS class selector -> "." is for class.
                -CSS grouping  selector.
    Note: In CSS the way of comment is defferent, e.g : Syntax->  /*comment*/
